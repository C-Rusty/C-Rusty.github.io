                    The promotion strategy depends on the market capacity and competitiveness of the product. To begin with, we collected information and analyzed the Belarusian car market, the needs and wishes of customers, and compared the client’s marketing with the marketing of competitors. This research helped form a marketing foundation and structure, which subsequently influenced the increase in KIA's market share through promotion, positioning and competent development of the dealer network.
